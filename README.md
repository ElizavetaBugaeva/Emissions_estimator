# Final_project
Corporate Carbon Footprint Estimations using Machine Learning 

The project consists of 3 parts: 
1. Data Collection
   In this part publicly available data about set of 50 countries is collected from publicly available databases as well as scraped from websites such as www.macrotrends.net and companiesmarketcap.com using BeautifulSoup, cleaned and consolidated into one main dataframe.
2. Data Analysis
   In this part previosuly collected and consolidated data is split to train and test parts. Train part is analysed in order to find the relationship between the features and the targtes (Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions)
3. Machine Learning
     In this part ML algorithms are deployed and best performing models are saved as pkl files
